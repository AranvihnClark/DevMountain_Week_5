In my opinion, React seems like it woudl be very easy to use once you become used to the tendencies that it has. The fact that think of each function as a component like how Java their classes is kind of interesting. Their key difference, of course, being that the components only have one function.

Honestly, it feels very convoluted and unecessary yet also very useful. I don't see myself becoming an expert in it unless needed but I do think that the way React structures itself is not as horrible as I initially thought it would be. I did like how easy it seemed to reuse each component after it has been set up. I just don't really like the initial setup is all.

Not sure what pursuing React would be like, honestly. It just seems boring to design a website. Moreso, I would feel like I need to have multiple projects from multiple companies going on so that I can have a steady income - though it probably isn't like that at all. Just a thought, although probably ignorant. I just don't see myself doing this for a living.
