I really like Java. It follows many of the syntax that C++, which I am more familiar with. I do prefer the structure that it dictates for the user to follow. I enjoy just writing code like the exercise just now, honestly. I don't know if there really isn't anything that I don't like about Java. 

I'm honestly not sure what pursuing Java would be like for me. I've always just thought that I would be more of a back-end developer/software developer. I enjoy making algorithms and making sense of a problem using programming languages. It is weirdly fun for me and I don't get bored easily. When doing JavaScript, I find myself just working for hours and not realizing how much time has passed. I hope to be pushed into the Java specialization. But, if not, I will definitely continue to learn Java on my own time as that will be the direction I want to go in myself, not React.
